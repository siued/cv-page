This is my personal website.  
Instead of having an AI-generated frontend, I decided to create a clean API which has all the details about me.  
I often notice that API documentation is incomplete, incorrect or missing.  
Hence, I am making sure that this API documents itself via autogenerated Swagger to ensure correctness and completeness.  
The Swagger API documentation serves as the frontend (as you probably noticed since you're looking at it :)  
Currently this is still WIP. I am in the process of adding more data and endpoints.
