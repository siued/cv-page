# Welcome!

This is my personal website.  
Instead of having an AI-generated frontend, I decided to create a clean API with my personal details.

Currently this is still WIP. I am in the process of adding more data and endpoints.

## The groundbreaking idea

To make my website unique, I decided to take a different approach to frontend. In the wild west of service integration, I often notice that API documentation is incomplete, incorrect or missing. Hence, I decided to let the API speak for itself and have the API reference be the frontend.

I see this as an exercise in following API design conventions. The code is written such that it documents itself using built-in tooling from the NestJS framework using OpenAPI. I like the challenge of using nothing but the OpenAPI specification to display everything.
